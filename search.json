The 21st century has seen powerful advances in computer hardware and software leading to a rapid increase in the exploitation of computation within the natural sciences, social sciences, and engineering disciplines.\nSignificant advances have brought numerical modelling, data analysis and simulation disciplines to the forefront. There has been a large ground swell in the use of programming and scripting across all disciplines.\nThe computational and data literacy skill sets required by modern academics and researchers across all disciplines have undergone a step change.\n\nOur focus is the many researchers who can benefit (or have the potential to benefit) from computational/numerical know-how and knowledge.\n\nSNAP has been set-up to connect, support and enable researchers across diverse disciplines, particularly those who have a primary research domain outside of computing.\n\nOur aim is to facilitate better research undertaken more productively, efficiently, and expansively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck our blog for the latest activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnual SNAP Workshop\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatricia Hunt\n\n\nApr 18, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSNAP Discord Channel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRichard Littauer\n\n\nApr 1, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducible Research\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel Wrench\n\n\nFeb 20, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n Back to top",
